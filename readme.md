## Some Laravel samples

So far I have

- Tweaked this readme.md
- Installed Laravel SSH https://laravelcollective.com/docs/5.0/ssh#installation
- Used it to output unix fortunes: \app\Http\Controllers\UNIXFortuneController.php, \config\remote.php
- Added a homepage
- Added my brown corpus experiment
- Made a model. Was able to insert rows in database.
- Added old-school HTML guestbook.
- This code now runs on www.bogambo.net and is hosted by www.webrahost.com
